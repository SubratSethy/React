 To use React -> we use class components
                  -> in class components which we have 1. state manangement 2.Life Cycle Method        
Then later fuctional components came, -> in these we cannot use state management and life cycle method -> to use thesec features we have to redirect to class componments.
To solve this problem we use Hook -> which basically helps users to achieve the state management and life cycle method while using the fuctional components.
Before hooks, only class components could manage state and lifecycle events, but hooks allow functional components to do the same, making them more powerful and flexible. 

-> To use first import Hooks from react.
-> import React, { useState } from 'react';
-> hooks can only be called inside the react function components.
     -> function MyComponent() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        This is correct.
     -> const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        This is incorrect.
-> hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
-> hooks can not be conditional i.e; we can not use conditional statements within it.
-> syntax of usestate hook
    usestate hook returns an array of 2 elements i.e; state is state variable and setState is updated function.
    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
    example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
    here, 0 is initial value of state variable state.
